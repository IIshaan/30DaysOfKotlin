# 30DaysOfKotlin
On this repository I will be updating all the stuff that I do every day related to Kotlin for the 30DaysofKotlin Challenge proposed by Google Dev India

# Day 1:
I learnt how to work with the Kotlin REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) interactive shell, and I practiced using the basic syntax of Kotlin code.
Also learnt about the data types and *VAR* and *VAL* and their limitations and use.
