# 30DaysOfKotlin
On this repository I will be updating all the stuff that I do every day related to Kotlin for the 30DaysofKotlin Challenge proposed by Google Dev India

# Day 1:
Today was my first day. I learnt how to work with the Kotlin REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) interactive shell, and I practiced using the basic syntax of Kotlin code.<br>
Also learnt about the data types and *VAR* and *VAL* and their limitations and use. Very excited for the next 29 days and going to learn and use time efficiently during this Pandemic.

# Day 2:
I started today with conditional statements and Booleans. If else was the first one. Then I went to _"when"_ statement which was like the _"Switch"_ statement in other languages. Next I learnt about nullable versus non-nullable variables. Also first time I used Double-bang operator (!!).<br>
Lastly it was all about arrays, lists and loops. New points here for me were 1) Loopong through the elements and the indexes at the same time 2) Stepping backward using downTo in a loop 3) Repeat Loops.

# Day 3:
Today was a long day of playing with functions. Starting from main() and moving to much complicated one's like passing an arguement or parameter in a function or passing a function in a function. Learnt how to make functions compact and how to create a filter of both eager and lazy types. Used _Sequence()_ and _asSequence_() for the same. <br>
Used the map() function which helps to perform a simple transformation on each element in the sequence. Lastly it was all about lambdas and higher order functions (a function that takes two arguments).

# Day 4:
Today I started with the classes. Studying all the parameters of classes deeply, moved onto class constructers, INIT, secondary constructors, property getter and setter. Next it was the visibility modifiers i.e Public, Protected, Private and Internal. Ended the day with subclasses and and inheritance. Lastly it was the use of override property in many examples.
