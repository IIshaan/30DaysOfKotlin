# 30DaysOfKotlin
On this repository I will be updating all the stuff that I do every day related to Kotlin for the 30DaysofKotlin Challenge proposed by Google Dev India

# Day 1:
Today was my first day. I learnt how to work with the Kotlin REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) interactive shell, and I practiced using the basic syntax of Kotlin code.
Also learnt about the data types and *VAR* and *VAL* and their limitations and use. Very excited for the next 29 days and going to learn and use time efficiently during this Pandemic.

# Day 2:
I started today with conditional statements and Booleans. If else was the first one. Then I went to _"when"_ statement which was like the _"Switch"_ statement in other languages. Next I learnt about nullable versus non-nullable variables. Also first time I used Double-bang operator (!!).
Lastly it was all about arrays, lists and loops. New points here for me were 1) Loopong through the elements and the indexes at the same time 2) Stepping backward using downTo in a loop 3) Repeat Loops.
